/*
Package macle2go links macle output and gene ontologies (GO).

This package contains the programs macle2go and cmq. Macle computes a
measure of complexity, C_M, in a sliding window along a DNA
sequence. These observed complexity values can be compared to the
values expected in random DNA sequences. The program cmq computes the
quantiles of the distribution of C_M in random DNA sequences.
